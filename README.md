# Javascript-Journey-of-the-Zoombinis

# Project Description
This is a Javascript/Node.js version of the classic PC game Logical Journey of the Zoombinis.<br>
Using the inquirer package, the user is prompted to solve a series of logical problems.<br>

This game was created as an opportunity to practice my Javascript;<br>
please see notations within script.js if curious.<br>

# How to Play
Clone/DL Javascript Journey, open it with your CLI, then use Node to run:<br>
node script.js<br>
From there, just answer the prompts, and think logically!<br>

## Notes
A recent group project emphasized for me my relative weakness with Javascript;<br>
espcially "vanilla," or JQuery-less, Javascript.<br>
This is an effort to correct that deficiency with practice, practice, practice!<br>
